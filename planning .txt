Idea of Minimax Algorithm from: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37 


A Minimax algorithm can be best defined as a recursive function that does the following things:

    1. return a value if a terminal state is found (+10, 0, -10)
    2. go through available spots on the board
    3. call the minimax function on each available spot (recursion)
    4. evaluate returning values from function calls
    5. and return the best value


Tic Tac Toe Board is an array:
["0","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]

    0 | 1 | 2
    ---------
    3 | 4 | 5
    ---------
    6 | 7 | 9	
	

CPU vs Human set up:
aiPlayer = "X"
huPlayer = "O"

Min max:
human player wins: score = -10
ai    player wins: score = +10
tie              : score =   0 
	->Length of available spots = 0
***If the minimax function does not find a terminal state, it keeps recursively going level by level deeper into the game. This recursion happens until it reaches a terminal state and returns a score one level up.***
